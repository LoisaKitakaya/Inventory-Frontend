          is a web application that is used to record and display items and
          materials in storage.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p class="subtitle is-underlined">Why this app</p>
        <p>Some of the reasons behind the creation of this application:</p>
        <br />
        <ul>
          <li>
            <i class="bi bi-arrow-right"></i> The convenience of having
            information by just logging in to your account. You can now view all
            the items/materials in storage whenever and wherever. No more phone
            calls to inquire if a certain object is in storage or not.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <i class="bi bi-arrow-right"></i> Knowing which items are in storage
            and which are not reduce the chances of buying things twice. Without
            a consistent record of the items in storage, some items have been
            bought more than is required.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <i class="bi bi-arrow-right"></i> Having an inventory of the items
            in storage makes for informed decisions on the items/materials; in
            regard to increasing or decreasing the quantity of the items.
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <i class="bi bi-arrow-right"></i> Knowing the condition of the
            materials in storage. This information is important before
            undertaking a project e.g. construction. Knowing the reliability of
            the materials to be used can save money, time, and energy.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p class="subtitle is-underlined">How the app works</p>
        <br />
        <p>
          The application in general is actually two applications connected
          together. They are as follows:
        </p>
        <br />
        <ul>
          <li>
            <i class="bi bi-arrow-right"></i> The backend application (the core
            app), hosts the database, and handles all database operations
            (creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting records). This
            application is accessible to the admin (or whoever is responsible
            for archiving the items in storage).
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            <i class="bi bi-arrow-right"></i> The frontend application (What you
            are currently using), fetches data from the core app and displays it
            in an organized way. This application is accessible to everyone
            else.
          </li>
        </ul>
